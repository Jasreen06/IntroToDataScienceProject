## What are the differences in cancellation rates based on meal plan type, lead time, room type, and market segment, and what are the 95% confidence intervals for these rates?

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the dataset
df <- read.csv("Dataset/INNHotelsGroup.csv")

# Step 1: Check for missing values
colSums(is.na(df))  # Check for any missing values in the dataset

# Step 2: View unique values in 'type_of_meal_plan'
unique(df$type_of_meal_plan)

# Step 3: Create a binary column for cancellations (1 = canceled, 0 = not canceled)
df$canceled <- ifelse(df$booking_status == "Canceled", 1, 0)

# Step 4: Summarize cancellation rates by meal plan
meal_plan_summary <- df %>%
  group_by(type_of_meal_plan) %>%
  summarise(total_bookings = n(),
            total_cancellations = sum(canceled),
            cancellation_rate = mean(canceled))

#print(meal_plan_summary)

# Step 5: Visualize cancellation rates by meal plan using a bar plot
ggplot(meal_plan_summary, aes(x = type_of_meal_plan, y = cancellation_rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +

## How does the lead time and average room price affect the cancellation ?

**T testing for average room price
```{r}
# Subsetting the data for customers who canceled (canceled == 1)
df$canceled <- ifelse(df$booking_status == "Canceled", 1, 0)
df_canceled <- subset(df, canceled == 1)

# Subsetting the data for customers who did not cancel (canceled == 0)
df_not_canceled <- subset(df, canceled == 0)

# Performing a t-test to compare average price per room between those who canceled and those who didn't
ttest_avg_price_per_room <- t.test(df_canceled$avg_price_per_room, df_not_canceled$avg_price_per_room, 
                       alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
#ttest_result <- t.test(df_not_canceled$avg_price_per_room,df_canceled$avg_price_per_room, 
#                       alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
interpret_ttestavg_price_per_room <- function(ttest_avg_price_per_room) {
  p_value <- ttest_avg_price_per_room$p.value  # Extract the p-value from the t-test result
  
  # Print the test summary
  print(ttest_avg_price_per_room)
  
  # Interpret based on the p-value threshold (commonly set at 0.05)
  if (p_value < 0.05) {
    cat("Conclusion:\n")
    cat("There is a statistically significant difference in the average price per room between customers who canceled and those who did not.\n")
    cat("The p-value is less than 0.05, meaning the observed difference in means is unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n")
  } else {
    cat("Conclusion:\n")
    cat("There is no statistically significant difference in the average price per room between customers who canceled and those who did not.\n")
    cat("The p-value is greater than 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the difference in means is zero.\n")
  }
}

# Call the function with the t-test result
interpret_ttestavg_price_per_room(ttest_avg_price_per_room)

```
**T testing for Lead time
```{r}
ttestlead_time <- t.test(df_canceled$lead_time, df_not_canceled$lead_time, 
                       alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
